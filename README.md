Business Case
NE Animal Hospital is stuck in the past using spreadsheets and outdated paper processes to keep track of its clients. Transitioning to an application would allow for a centralized system where all information could be found quickly, in one place. The customer experiences regularly scheduled visits and emergency visits daily that need to be logged for optimal scheduling. The application does not allow for overlap between appointments which would help the customer manage their day effectively. Additionally, with a database that is stored in the cloud, the customer will not require any data to be stored on-site and will be able to access information anywhere provided an internet connection is available. A cloud-based database also would benefit the company in the event they look to expand its services to other areas.
